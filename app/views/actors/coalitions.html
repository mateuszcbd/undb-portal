                <h1>Coalitions for Enhanced Implementation</h1>
                <p >Parties and other Governments, along with partner organizations and other stakeholders, are invited to announce actions underway that are related to particular Aichi Biodiversity Targets or groups of targets, or to make commitments for planned actions in support of the Convention and the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020. <a href="https://www.cbd.int/sp/">https://www.cbd.int/sp/ </a></p>

                <p >It is expected that such actions and commitments should be:
                    <ul class="basic-list">
                      <li>commensurate with the scale and scope of the global Aichi Biodiversity Targets, and</li>
                      <li> include clear timelines and mechanisms to track progress against specific baselines, with clear progress expected within a two-year or four-year period.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
<p>Linkages between such actions and the achievement of certain Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs">https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs</a> can also be highlighted.</p>

<p>A group of countries, with supporting partners as appropriate, with commitments on a common target or group of targets can constitute a “coalition for enhanced implementation”. Such a coalition can include:
  <ul class="basic-list">
    <li>Leading countries: countries that have already achieved, or already undertaking activities that put them on track to achieve a given Aichi Biodiversity Target or group of targets (or element of the target(s)). Such countries may also pledge further commitments and actions, and/or offer technical or other support to other countries willing to make pledges. </li>
<li>Implementing countries: countries making commitments to achieve the target(s). Such countries may need technical or other support to do so. </li>
<li>Enabling partners: organizations that commit to support countries in the coalition to support the target(s) through clearly measureable activities, and business sector entities making substantive contributions towards the target(s). </li>
  </ul>
